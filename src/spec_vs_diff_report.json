Backend changes ensure getCertificate and getAllCertificates return data in the same format as photo methods. Frontend changes add comprehensive console logging for debugging, implement certificate rendering in the gallery grid with the same visual treatment as photos, and ensure proper blob URL handling. All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed.",
