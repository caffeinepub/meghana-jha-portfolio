  "summary": "The implementation covers most requirements comprehensively. All frontend sections (hero, profile, contact, education, projects, skills, hobbies, languages, references) are implemented with correct data. Backend functionality for file uploads is present. The main gap is the absence of the two required generated images in the frontend/public/assets/generated directory.",
